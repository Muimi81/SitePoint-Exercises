            I remember reading <cite>Salem's Lot</cite> by Stephen King as a child, and being very
            scared of the dark for days after.

                It didn't take long for a daily routine to form: when they left for work in the
                morning I'd still be in bed. And when they came home they'd find me sitting on the
                sofa, drinking beer and watching TV soaps.

            Although Jimmy was told to <strong>never</strong> put his hands on the exhaust pipe,
            he <em>still</em> couldn't help himself.

            The limerick packs laughs anatomical, <br/>
            Into the space that is quite economical. <br/>
            But the good ones I've seen, <br/>
            So seldom are clean, <br/>
            And the clean ones so seldom are comical.
