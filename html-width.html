        <P>
            We've stayed in quite a few caravan parks and camp sites over the last couple of months, and I've started to
            notice a few things that seem to suggest that there are some unwritten rules of staying at these places.
            Unwritten until now, that is.
        </P>
        <p class="highlight">
            Everyone else on site will be better prepared and better equipped than you. It's a fact. No matter what extras
            you might carry, someone a couple of plots down hill will still have more. Utensil envy is rife.
        </p>
        <p class="attentiongrab">
            When you first pack, the distance between the power supply and your van's power socket will be precisely 2 inches
            longer than the inadequate power lead that you own.
        </p>
        <P>
            On the hottest evenings, you will be parked next to someone with a very flashy van that's eqquiped with an
            air-con unit. It will be facing you, blowing out hot air and taunting you with its effecient hum.
        </P>
