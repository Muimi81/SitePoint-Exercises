            About Us
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up for
            diving trips in the summer months when the weather is good and the bacons rolls are
            flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the costs of accomodation accomodation
            and travel and ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we are based in the south-west, we don't stay on our own turf: past diving weekends
            away have included trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerpus wreck sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub to talk about our recent adventures
            (any excuses, eh?).
        </p>
