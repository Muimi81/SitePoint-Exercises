<body>
    <p>
        This is a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is another paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is yet  another paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
        And just one more paragraph.
    </p>
    <div>
        This is a div.
    </div>
    <div>
        The content of each div appears on a new line.
    </div>
    <div>

        A div is a generic block-level container.
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            This is a paragraph inside a div.
        </p>
        <p>
            So this is.
        </p>
    </div>
